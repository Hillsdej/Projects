Idea of how to do things

Game intro

1. Create background for intro page
2. Create block function which will be used to create the buttons
   - These will take take the rectangles x,y, widht and height values along with the colour as arguments.
3. Modify Func function for displaying texts
4. Create a button function which gets the mouse position
5. Modify colour to change lighter as to suggest interactivity
6. Import game_intro function into main and call before the main while loop
